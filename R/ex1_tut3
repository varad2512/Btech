Hospital data

Description

The table relates the length of stay (in years) of 132 long-term schizophrenic patients in two London mental hospitals with the frequency of visits.

Usage

data("Hospital")
Format

A 2-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 132 patients. The variables and their levels are as follows:

No	 Name	 Levels
1	 Visit Frequency	 Regular, Less than monthly, Never
2	 Length of Stay	 2--9 years, 10--19 years, 20+ years
Details

Wing (1962) who collected this data concludes that the longer the length of stay in hospital, the less frequent the visits.

Haberman (1974) notes that this pattern does not increase from the "Less than monthly" to the "Never" group, which are homogeneous.
